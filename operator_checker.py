# Use Camparison to find out a whether a given variable a is greater than 'b' or not.
# I'll take a = 34 and b = 80 .
a = 34
b = 80
if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")
else:
    print("a is not greater than b")
# This code checks if 'a' is greater than 'b' and prints the result.

# Output :
# a is not greater than b
